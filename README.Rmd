This repository contains the raw data and R scripts for "Quantification of an Adverse Outcome Pathway network by Bayesian regression and Bayesian network modelling" by Moe *et al.*, 2020. A link to the final version of the article will be added here in the future. 

The `data` folder contains the raw data used for the analyses, and the `scripts` folder contains the R scripts which were written for the analyses. The fitted models are in the `models` folder, and simulated data are in the `simulations` and `regression_simulations` folders, respectively. 

The following R package needs to be installed to run the analysis:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("brms")
```
