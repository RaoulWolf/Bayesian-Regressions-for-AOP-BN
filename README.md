regression and Bayesian network modeling
================

This repository contains the raw data and R scripts for “Quantification
of an Adverse Outcome Pathway network by Bayesian regression and
Bayesian network modeling” by Moe *et al.*, 2020. The final version of
the article was published in Integrated Environmental Assessment and
Management and can be found here: <https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4348>.

The `data` folder contains the raw data used for the analyses, and the
`scripts` folder contains the R scripts which were written for the
analyses. The fitted models are in the `models` folder, and simulated
data are in the `simulations` and `regression_simulations` folders,
respectively.

The following R package needs to be installed to run the analysis:

``` r
install.packages("brms")
```
